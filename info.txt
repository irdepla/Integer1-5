                                                            HISTORY OF JAVASCRIPT
1. Birth of JavaScript (1995):
Inventor: JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich at Netscape Communications. Originally, it was developed in just 10 days to run inside Netscape's web browser.


Initial Name: It was first called Mocha, then LiveScript, before being renamed JavaScript in a marketing move to ride the popularity of Java (even though Java and JavaScript are very different).


Purpose: It was designed as a lightweight scripting language for web pages to make them interactive, as HTML and CSS alone were static. 

JavaScript grew rapidly due to the increasing popularity of the web.
Internet Explorer (IE) and Netscape Navigator were the dominant browsers at the time, each with their own implementations of JavaScript, leading to compatibility issues.
DHTML (Dynamic HTML) emerged in the late '90s, combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create interactive websites.


                                                            Primitive and Reference data types

Primitive types are simple, immutable values. This means that once a primitive value is created, it cannot be altered.

Types of primitive data types:

Number: e.g., 10, 3.14
String: e.g., 'Hello', "JavaScript"
